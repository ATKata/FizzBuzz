FizzBuzz
========
A kid's counting game which should hopefully be a bit simpler to implement.
See this link for details http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/fizz-buzz/

It's been setup as a gradle project so should easily import into Eclipse / IntelliJ.
A skeleton for using the Cucumber BDD tool has been included, you should be able to find plugins for your IDE,
but failing that you can simply run it as a JUnit test or via the "gradle cucumber" task.

If you run the existing .feature file you should get some helpful suggestions in the ouput
as to what step definitions you're missing, implement them in the Stepdefs class and all should be well.

Good luck ;-)
